## Summary

- What changed?
- Why was this change needed?

## Validation

- [ ] Architecture boundaries remain explicit and framework glue has not leaked into domain or application logic
- [ ] Repository-facing documentation affected by this change is updated in English
- [ ] Build, compile, lint, and static validation are green where applicable
- [ ] Automated tests are green
- [ ] Coverage remains at or above the enforced repository threshold
- [ ] Required CI workflows remain blocking, not advisory
- [ ] A green `main` update still dispatches the image build to `platform-infra` (deploys are manual-only; the k3s staging host no longer exists)
